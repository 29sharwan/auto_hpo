  **Automated Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) System**
__Overview__
This project aims to develop an automated Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) system that leverages AutoML techniques to efficiently identify the best hyperparameter configurations for various machine learning models. The system integrates multiple machine learning models and employs advanced optimization techniques like Bayesian Optimization and Tree-Parzen Estimator (TPE).

__Features__
__Supports multiple machine learning models__: Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, MLP, and KNN.
__Employs efficient AutoML techniques for HPO__: Utilizes Bayesian Optimization and TPE for hyperparameter optimization.
__Evaluates performance__: Measures model performance using ROC AUC score and cross-validation.
__Compares learning rate distribution curves__: Visualizes and compares learning rate distributions among different optimization methods.
